        <h4>1. Quote calculator (Help to calculate total cost to be paid)</h4>
        <p>
          QR code payments are made via the customer's smartphone when they scan
          the code. Once scanned, they are taken to a payment page where they
          will have the option to enter their chosen payment details or use a
          mobile payment solution to complete the transaction.
          <br /><br />
          A vendor can also scan a QR code on their customer's phone. This code
          is provided by their bank or payment app and will contain their card
          details, which the business can use to finalize the transaction.

        <h4>2. Migration route</h4>
        <p>
          One of the major lessons from the pandemic era is that business
          process configuration is a key requirement for ensuring business
          continuity. <br />
          In the current African business landscape, business owners express
          their frustrations over the rising rate of developer attritions and
          the shortage of developers that can help them design and develop
          business process automation. Most of the available process management
          solutions are built around an expensive budget, complex architecture,
          and take time to implement.
